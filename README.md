sensiblequery deployment environment

## Install Docker

Install Docker and set the data directory to `/data/docker/`.

## Install docker-compose

You can execute the `docker-compose` to run the instance.

## start bitcoind (Bitcoin SV node)

Start the bitcoind container from the `/data/bitcoind` directory.

    cd /data/bitcoind
    docker-compose up -d

You can execute `bitcoin-cli` like so:

    ./bitcoin-cli.sh getinfo

### Configure RPC settings

* bitcoind/data/bitcoin.conf
```
    rpcuser=ss
    rpcpassword=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
## Start clickhouse

Start the clickhouse container from the `/data/clickhouse` directory.

    cd /data/clickhouse
	# chown -R 101:101 .
    docker-compose up -d

## Start redis

Start the redis container from the `/data/redis` directory.

    cd /data/redis
    # chown -R 990:990 data
    docker-compose up -d

## Start sensibled

First, pull in the image

    docker-compose pull

Or build the image from source yourself here: (https://github.com/sensible-contract/sensibled):

    git clone https://github.com/sensible-contract/sensibled
    cd sensibled
    docker-compose build

There are three stages of synchronisation that will occur: Initial synchronisation, batch synchronisation followed by continuous syncrhonisation.

Execute the following commands from the `/data/sensibled` directory to complete the three phases of synchronisation.

    cd /data/sensibled

    # Initialisation
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-init.yaml up
    ...

    # Batch synchronisation
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-batch.yaml up
    ...

    # Continuous synchronisation in the background
    docker-compose up -d

### Key configuration

The intranet IP address (172.31.88.41) should be replaced with the actual node address.

You also can change `extra_hosts` in docker-compose.yaml.

* chain.yaml
```
    zmq: "tcp://172.31.88.41:16331"
    rpc: "http://172.31.88.41:16332"
    rpc_auth: "ss:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```
* db.yaml
```
    address: "172.31.88.41:9000"
    database: "bsv"
```
* redis.yaml
```
    addrs: ["172.31.88.41:6379"]
```
## Run sensiblequery

Pull in the docker imageï¼š

    docker-compose pull

Or build it yourself from source (https://github.com/sensible-contract/sensiblequery):

    git clone https://github.com/sensible-contract/sensiblequery
    cd sensiblequery
    docker-compose build


Start the docker image from the `/data/sensiblequery`directory.

    cd /data/sensiblequery
    docker-compose up -d

### Key configuration

Intranet IP address (172.31.88.41  should be replaced with the actual node address.

You also can change `extra_hosts` in docker-compose.yaml.

* chain.yaml
```
    rpc: "http://172.31.88.41:16332"
    rpc_auth: "ss:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```
* db.yaml
```
    address: "172.31.88.41:9000"
    database: "bsv"
```
* redis.yaml
```
    addrs: ["172.31.88.41:6379"]
```
* cache.yaml
```
    addr: "172.31.88.41:6380"
```

## Filebeat logger settings

Settings are configurable in `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yaml`

Container logs will be lost after restart and will need to be persisted if you want to keep them.

# Install nginx

Settings are configurable in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`.

# Install frpc

Start the FRPC forwarding agent to remotely expose your Bitcoin node to the Hong Kong node according to the settings in `/etc/frp/frpc.ini`.

If the machine is already publicly exposed, there is no need to use FRPC.

### FRPC Key Configuration

* frpc.ini
```
    token = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## Caution

The block synchronisation process is divided into two steps: First, the blocks will be scanned (either individually or in batches) and will update the db and redis all at once.

If the program crashes while writing to the db or redis, they will enter an error state. In an error state, the db can no longer be used. There is currently no way to fix this, it can only be restored from a backup.

At present, redis has turned off the automatic backup of rdb/aof, so manual operations are required to back up and restore its data.

It is recommended that you run multiple copies of the service. During the backup/restore process, it is preferable that the service be taken offline.
